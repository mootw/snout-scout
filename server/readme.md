# Info

The server acts as a central store of information that can handle the specific data format that snout-scout uses.
It is efficient, and can push chunks to clients in real time using web sockets. The server hosts on port 6749 by
default and it should be proxied over https for competition use using a reverse proxy like nginx. Web browsers generally allow insecure socket connections on localhost only, for local development this is fine. **The proxy must
support handling web socket upgrade requests or real time updates will not work.** 


You must configure these environment variables (can be a .env file)

upload_password=Password for the server to accept file upload OR file deletion (by default it is "" if not set)


# Docker


in the main root directory of the repo build the docker file 
`docker build -t snout-scout .`

run the container like this to expose the port, and also
bind the events directory to the container so that it can read
your event files.

`docker run -p 6749:6749 -v "$(pwd)"/events:/events snout-scout`


# Setup

Either compile or use a pre-compiled binary for the server.

`dart compile exe server.dart`

The directory should contain an events folder which will contain the json database files.
